This way, you won't have to deal with program files scattered all over your hard drive.  Chocolatey manages them for you.\r\n\r\nGit package on Chocolatey;  http://chocolatey.org/packages/git.install\r\n\r\nThe first time you use a repo, you need to clone it:  \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ngit clone https://<your account name>@bitbucket.org/vpulse/ecommerce.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, go change some files.\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\nto stage the code for commit: (from the root of the repo directory, this will stage everything that's changed\"\r\n  \r\n```\r\n\r\ngit add . \r\n```\r\n  \r\nthen commit the changes to your local repo:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ngit commit -m \"JIRA_TICKET:  check in comments here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nnever check code in without a comment, and JIRA number is required for our team.\r\n\r\nto \"push\" your committed repo to the remote repo:\r\n     \r\n```\r\n\r\ngit push\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will prompt you for your sign in credential.  that's how you know your code is being synced with a remote repo.\r\n\r\nTo get changes from other people:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ngit fetch\r\n```\r\n     \r\n```\r\n\r\ngit status\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\ngit pull\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember, \r\n     \r\n```\r\n\r\ngit status\r\n```\r\nis your friend.  You can learn a lot by reading the status message.\r\n\r\nPlease learn git by using these simple command lines as above, until you feel comfortable with git (takes 2-3 days)  After that, use any graphic tools you like.  there are many good ones.  with an understanding of the commands, it will be much more productive to use a tool because you will understand what the tool is doing under the cover.
